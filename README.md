# javascript-set-matching-game

This is a single-page JavaScript game.  It generates a series of cards with different characteristics (number, shape, color, and fill).  The goal of the game is to select 3 cards that form a set, where all of the characteristics between the cards must be the same or different.

The cards are drawn using standard SVG.  The page imports [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) (from CDN sources).

You can play the game directly from [here](https://jparrpearson.github.io/javascript-set-matching-game/).
